Functions:
==========
1. pre-defined (alert(),prompt(),confirm(),max(),min(),sqrt(),cbrt())
	already written, we are just using them
2. user-defined
	we have to write,and we will use them
   
   a. function declaration (named function)
   b. function expression(anonymous)
   c. self invoked ( IIFE- Immediately Invoked Function Expression)
   d. arrow function (ES - 6)(2015)
  

Note:
=====
Parameter: is the variable in the function declaration. 
		   It is part of the function signature when you create it.
Argument: is the actual value of the variable being passed to the function when it is called.



Function Declaration			Function Expression
--------------------------------------------------------
1. Named						1. Anonymous
2. Hoisting - yes				2. Hoisting - No
3. creation phase(parse)		3. execution phase (run)

   
-A Function Expression is created when the execution reaches it and is usable only from that moment.
-A Function Declaration can be called before it is defined.
-function declarations are parsed before their execution. 
 function expressions are parsed only when the script engine encounters it during execution.


Arrow Function
--------------
-'this' value inside a regular function is dynamic and depends on the context in which it is called.
-Arrow function doesn't have its own 'this' binding
'this' inside the arrow function is bound lexically and equals to 'this' where the function is declared.
-lexical context means that arrow function uses 'this' from the code that contains the arrow function.
-Regular function ( this = how the function is invoked/who invoked )
-Arrow function( this = where the function is declared )


Arrow Function Limitations
--------------------------
-Arrow functions don't have their own bindings to this, arguments or super cann't be used inside arrow function.
-Arrow functions don't have access to the new,target keyword.
-Arrow functions aren't suitable for call, apply and bind methods, which generally rely on establishing a scope.
-Arrow functions cannot be used as constructors.
-Arrow functions cannot use yield, within its body.


Arrow Function Benefits
-----------------------
-Concise syntax
-Implicit return
-Lexical 'this' Binding
-no arguments object(pre-defined keyword)
-ideal for callbacks
-good for small functions
-static 'this' (this doesn't change)




IIFE
====
-used when we try to avoid polluting the global scope, 
-The variables declared inside the IIFE are not visible outside its scope.
-closure
